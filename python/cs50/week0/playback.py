# ASSIGNMENT:
# In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts 
# the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space 
# with ... (i.e., three periods).

toofast = input("Say something, fool: ")

print("Yeesh, slow the heck down")
print(toofast.replace(" ", "..."))
