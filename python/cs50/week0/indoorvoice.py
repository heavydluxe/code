## ASSIGNMENT
## Implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs
## that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted 
## unchanged.

# Get input string...
mixedinput = input("Say something here: ")

# Change to all lowercase then print
inside = mixedinput.lower()
print("We use inside voices here!!")
print(inside)

## SOLUTION:
## I got this right, but it could've been simplified to:
# mixedinput = input("Say something here: ")
# print("We use inside voices here!!")
# print(mixedinput.lower())
